# Specification Quality Checklist: In-Memory Python Console Todo Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED (2025-12-28)
**Validator**: Claude Sonnet 4.5

All checklist items validated successfully. Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` phase.

### Key Findings:
- 4 prioritized user stories covering all 5 core features
- 14 functional requirements with specific, testable criteria
- 6 measurable success criteria (all technology-agnostic)
- 12 acceptance scenarios (3 per user story)
- 5 edge cases documented
- 9 documented assumptions for clarity
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all decisions made with reasonable defaults

## Notes

Specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for implementation planning.
